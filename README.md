## 🔧 Featured Projects

### 🔹 [Edge Blogs](https://edgeblogs.pythonanywhere.com)
A blog platform with:
- User authentication, content upload, and comment system
- Custom-built recommendation engine based on top keyword tags and user behavior (likes, reads, follows). No ML libraries — all logic hand-coded
- Built using Django + SQLite.

### 🔹 [Edge Games](https://edgegames.pythonanywhere.com)
Browser-based gaming platform:
- Users can play uploaded HTML/JS games with asset hosting (CSS, JS, images, audio)
- Developers can upload thier game with full asset support served via generated urls
- Includes a high-score API which tracks global/personal scores, user cookies for guest play, supports 
score-linking post signup, and leaderboard fetch. All APIs are JS-callable and designed for easy developer 
integration. 

### 🔹 River Cleaner Bot (ESP32)
Waste-cleaning robot:
- Uses ESP32 with motor drivers and Python Flask-based server
- Hosted a local web interface to control movement from any device via IP (phone/laptop)
- Movement is fully remote-controlled over Wi-Fi



### 🔹 Landmine Detector Bot (Raspberry Pi)
Terrain-scanning detection bot:
- Uses a magnetic coil to detect underground metal presence
- Raspberry Pi runs a Flask server that hosts a local control panel
- Robot is manually controlled from a mobile or laptop browser via IP; triggers alert if metal is detected



### 🔹 [Edge Tasks](https://edgetasks.pythonanywhere.com)
Simple task management web app:
- Login system, task creation, editing, priorities, due dates and collaboration features between different users for projects
- Built using Django + SQLite; responsive UI for desktop/mobile use

### 🔹 CFD Simulation – Biomass Cookstove
Simulated airflow inside a biomass cookstove using ANSYS Fluent:
- Modeled turbulent combustion, air intake paths, and heat transfer  
- Goal: optimize design for cleaner burn and higher thermal efficiency  
- Worked with boundary conditions, meshing, and result visualization
